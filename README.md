# Lexical-Analyzer
 The Lexical Analyzer project in C is designed to identify elements such as operators, symbols, identifiers, keywords, and literals. It scans the input program line by line, categorizing tokens based on predefined patterns and regular expressions. The project involves using C programming techniques to detect and differentiate various token types.
